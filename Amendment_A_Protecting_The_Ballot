That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and 
purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of 
three-fourths of the several States: 
Section 1:
No President or any other person of the United States government 
may initiate first-use of any weapon of mass destruction against any 
person or persons anywhere in the world without written authorization 
of a two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress. Such authorization 
may not be in effect for more than thirty calendar days.
Section 2:
This Amendment overrides all other obligations of Oath and Duty, 
and therefore no individual who refuses to violate this Amendment may 
be prosecuted for dereliction of any other Oath or Duty to which that 
individual is subject.
Section 3:
The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate 
legislation.
